All search algorithems fail at an index of 3,000. I believe this has to do with memory. I can't imagine needing an index this large though.

Using the loopy algorithems, validating the input with an if statement  makes the algorithem slower by 0.00001 seconds.
However, if there is an error validating the input will allow the system to increase speed by 3 x10^5 seconds.

Okay. Turns out, that we don't need the loopy algoritem because I just need to know if the item exists in the dictionary object.
Then it returns the object.


Where I left off:
I have the search algoitem working properly now.
It will add the chosen object.

Now I need to attach it this to resolve.
